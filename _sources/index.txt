My coding notebook
==================

.. admonition:: About this repos.
   
   Here I keep my coding notes. Difference from my `snippets repos <https://wtak23.github.io/snippets/>`__ is two-fold:

   1. here I usually keep a more detailed notes
   2. The codes I keep in ``snippets`` is quite jumbled from many different resources. Here, I usually take notes from a fixed set of resource (*e.g.*, tutorial website, chapter from a book, etc)
